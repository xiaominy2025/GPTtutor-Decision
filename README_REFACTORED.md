# GPTTutor - Refactored Architecture

## 🚀 Overview

GPTTutor is a modular, maintainable decision-making tutor that synthesizes answers from course materials and supplements with GPT knowledge. The refactored architecture provides better maintainability, personalization, and frontend readiness.

## 🆕 Version 1.5: Decision Coach GPT System Prompt

**System Prompt Philosophy:**
- The AI is now a Decision Coach GPT, focused on helping students make better decisions by thinking clearly, strategically, and analytically when appropriate.
- Every answer is structured in five parts:
  1. **Strategic Framing**: Identify the decision type and key challenge.
  2. **Story in Action**: Use a short narrative (with a named character like Yin or Sarah) to illustrate the situation.
  3. **Analytical Tools (When Appropriate)**: If the decision involves uncertainty, trade-offs, optimization, or forecasting, introduce 1–2 relevant tools from the course (e.g., decision trees, Monte Carlo simulation, optimization, expected value, sensitivity analysis, predictive analysis, term sheet, behavior awareness, strategic analysis, financial analysis, competitive advantage) and explain how and why the tool helps.
  4. **Reflection Prompts**: Offer 2–3 thoughtful questions to help the student apply the strategy and/or tools to their context.
  5. **Concepts Recap**: Briefly list any tools or terms mentioned with a short definition or reminder.
- If the question is more emotional, ethical, or about personal values, the AI prioritizes clarity, empathy, and structured reflection, only including tools if they truly support the student’s thinking.
- The AI avoids generic motivational advice, focusing on insight, structure, and practical application.
- If the question is vague, the AI helps the student clarify the decision frame (alternatives, objectives, uncertainties, etc.).

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

```

### 3. Run the API Server
```bash
python api_server.py
```

### 4. Test the API
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Process query
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "How do I make a decision under uncertainty?"}'

# Get stats
curl http://localhost:5000/stats
```
